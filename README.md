  Cape - A Gatsby Content starter
</h1>

Kick off your project with this gatsby + contentful demo. You can have a look at this demo url: [https://cape.netlify.com/](https://cape.netlify.com/)

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using this starter
    npx gatsby new your-project-name https://github.com/juhi-trivedi/cape.git
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd your-project-name/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

## 🎓 Contentful

To run this starter, you need to add your own contentful credentials by creating _.contentful.json_ in root directory & add your 'spaceId' & 'accessToken' as shown below:

```sh
{
  "spaceId": "...",
  "accessToken": "..."
}
```
